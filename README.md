# Guess That Fart (Completed)

## Features
- Start game with a button
- Play placeholder fart sounds (implemented as console logs)
- Dynamic guess buttons for user interaction
- Score system (+1 for correct guesses)
- First-chunk implementation of game logic and UI

## What I Implemented
- These design decisions were guided by feedback from Lauren to enhance user experience.
- Created a start button to initiate the game
- Added placeholder fart sounds using console logs to simulate audio feedback
- Developed dynamic guess buttons that allow user interaction and guessing
- Implemented a scoring system that increments for correct guesses
- Built the initial game logic and user interface components
- Users answer by clicking dynamic guess buttons that update based on the game state.
- Each round ends immediately after a guess is made to keep gameplay concise.
- The fart sounds currently do not loop and are placeholders implemented as console logs.


## Difficult Part Tackled
- Managing dynamic UI updates for guess buttons based on game state
- Handling user interactions and ensuring score updates correctly
- Structuring game logic to be extendable for future features

## Future Work
- Replace placeholder fart sounds (console logs) with real audio files.
- Implement timers for each guess to increase challenge.
